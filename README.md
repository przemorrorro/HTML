# HTML
Project for study purposes

Pictures here must be added to folders to work properly after copying/downloading.
pictures with indexes 11 / 1010 / 55 etc, should be put in folder ,,moje hobby/zdjecia/mini".
This should fix every struggle with the page. 

It's not much but i like the major look of the page, i put a lot of work into detailing the page and keeping it in dark climate.
I deleted most of the photos to make the repository clearer, if the gallery wont work because of that, just delete the code including the pictures. I keep this code as a souvenir as it is one of my first pages done in HTML.
